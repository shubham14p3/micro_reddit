# Micro-Reddit

In this project, we are building a "Junior [Reddit](http://reddit.com/)" using Active Record to build databases that will allow us to create users, posts, and comments for the posts. We also created the appropriate associations amongst them to link each one with its respective other. Finally, added validations for each one of them to guaranty the users are not providing any incorrect information.
