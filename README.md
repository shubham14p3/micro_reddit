# Micro-Reddit

We are building a simpler Reddit called micro-reddit. In this project, we are using databsae necessary for  Active Records, Validations and commenting. We are not building the front end for it because we don’t need to. We are Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.
